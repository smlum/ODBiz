Okanagan Nation Aquatic Enterprises (OAE) Ltd.,"The Okanagan Nation Alliance is located in the interior of British Columbia. Our journey begins with a devoted effort to re-establish a sustainable population of Okanagan Sockeye Salmon in 2003. The Okanagan Nation Alliance is committed to bringing our salmon back by creating partnerships and by integrating modern science with traditional practices. Our goal for the future is to protect, enhance, conserve and continue to restore our salmon stocks so that we can have salmon for tomorrow. Responsible fisheries and quality management are eco-labelled Ocean Wise and independently certified to meet our high standards of Quality, Value and Sustainability. The Fishermen Beliefs and traditions are a very important part of First Nations’ culture and often reflect a deep understanding and respect for nature. Okanagan Select honors their roots by using holistic traditional practices of selective fishing—handed down from our ancestors. The Okanagan Nation has a dedicated group of fishermen who are committed to these methods and harvest only a small artisanal fishery. This fishery allocates annually- appropriate harvests, respecting community food and social needs, followed by economic opportunities. Sustainability Our goal is to provide a high quality product from sustainable fisheries that will not jeopardize our future wild salmon stocks. We want to honour the resiliency and prosperity of our natural environment by using only selective fishing methods. Using selective harvesting methods and quality control, we’re keeping an eye on the future without forgetting our past. We utilize abundance-based methods to allow the fish to get to the spawning grounds, honor ecosystem based fishery and practice lifecycle analysis to understand the fishery and it’s impacts. To ensure the sustainability of the salmon and our local ecosystem – fish are hand-picked with fish-friendly methods – e.g. troll, seine, traps, and dip net. The ONA has turned traditional concepts into modern selective fishing practices to minimize bi-catch.

Sheldon Dennis - Northwest Coast Artist of the Tahltan Nation,"Sheldon is a Tahltan First Nations fine artist who belongs to the wolf clan. He lived in Iskut, BC most of his life, but currently resides in Terrace, BC. In 2008, Sheldon decided to pursue his life long dream as a professional artist and began studying at the Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art. He values being taught by world renowned First Nations artists; Dempsey Bob, Stan Bevan, and Ken McNeil. Sheldon completed his second year of the fine arts program in 2010. He has discovered many Tahltan stories and legends that can be incorporated into Northwest Coast Art. He believes it is important to know who he is culturally; and a great way for him to accomplish this is through the fine art pieces he creates. Sheldon looks forward to keeping the native art form alive by passing down his knowledge to his children and future generations.     First Nations culture is coming back to our people, & I am honored to be a part of it.

Stuwix Resources Joint Venture,"Stuwix Resources is a fibre management and marketing company that are owned jointly by seven First Nations Bands located in the Southern Interior of British Columbia, Canada.    The establishment of Stuwix Resources has for the first time provided the ability to incorporate First Nation cultural and traditional use practices at the initial resource planning stage. This ensures First Nation culture practices are recognized, and encouraged as legitimate uses of the land. It is an opportunity to honor our ancestral beliefs and values. Stuwix Resources has developed a Forest Stewardship Plan that focuses on managing the forest land base with an emphasis on First Nation cultural values and practices.    Stuwix commenced harvesting and forest management operations in June 2005. Since that time, Stuwix has harvested 2.6 million cubic meters of timber on 7,975 hectares, planting over 8 million trees, which in turn contributes to the Merritt and surrounding economies in the form of payments to logging, hauling, roads, layout and development, and silviculture contractors.    Stuwix has created more than just economic opportunity. For many First Nations, the forest offers much more than logs. Through Stuwix Resources, first nation's individuals, companies, and communities are participating in and helping care for all that the forest has to offer. Stuwix has developed a Forest Stewardship plan for its operating area, which goes beyond the expectations with respect to First Nations consultation and protective measures dealing with water management, protection of wildlife habitat and biological diversity, soil conservation & protection of ecological, geographical, historical and culturally special sites.    Stuwix Resources is a Safe Certified Forest Company. All hired contractors must also be Safe Certified and currently have 'Zero' lost days due to non-injury. Stuwix Resources recently became Sustainable Forestry Initiative Certified. This demonstrates a commitment to higher standards of environmental stewardship.",2-98 Hwy 8 ,V0K 0A7,admin@stuwix.com,250-378-2277,,http://www.stuwix.com,Merritt,50.1071408,-120.7701804,"Stuwix Resources Joint Venture, ","2-98 Hwy 8 , Merritt, BC, V0K 0A7",TRUE,Thompson / Okanagan,Joint Venture,,2004,5 to 9,Agnes Holmes,,,,2015-01-06
